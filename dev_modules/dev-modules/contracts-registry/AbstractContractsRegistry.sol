/**
 *  @notice The ContractsRegistry module
 *
 *  The purpose of this module is to provide an organized registry of the project's smartcontracts
 *  together with the upgradeability and dependency injection mechanisms.
 *
 *  The ContractsRegistry should be used as the highest level smartcontract that is aware of any other
 *  contract present in the system. The contracts that demand other system's contracts would then inherit
 *  special `AbstractDependant` contract and override `setDependencies()` function to enable ContractsRegistry
 *  to inject dependencies into them.
 *
 *  The ContractsRegistry will help with the following usecases:
 *
 *  1) Making the system upgradeable
 *  2) Making the system contracts-interchangeable
 *  3) Simplifying the contracts management and deployment
 *
 *  The ContractsRegistry acts as a Transparent proxy deployer. One can add proxy-compatible implementations to the registry
 *  and deploy proxies to them. Then these proxies can be upgraded easily using the ContractsRegistry.
 *  The ContractsRegistry itself can be deployed behind a proxy as well.
 *
 *  The dependency injection system may come in handy when one wants to substitute a contract `A` with a contract `B`
 *  (for example contract `A` got exploited) without a necessity of redeploying the whole system. One would just add
 *  a new `B` contract to a ContractsRegistry and re-inject all the required dependencies. Dependency injection mechanism
 *  also works with factories.
 *
 *  The management is simplified because all of the contracts are now located in a single place.
